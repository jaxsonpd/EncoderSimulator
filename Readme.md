# Encoder Simulator

This project simulates a quadrature encoder using an Arduino and several push buttons. This can be used for testing decoding algorithms etc.

NOTE: The output circuitry is only needed to interface with a 3.3V logic circuit if testing another arduino etc. this is not needed. 

## How to Use
In order to use this simulator simply hook connect the ground of the Arduino with the ground of the circuit being tested. Then ensure that the pins are hooked up correctly. Download the program to the Arduino. Then use the buttons to simulate left and right rotations.

## ToDo
- Add Serial interface
- Test module
- Finish Readme
