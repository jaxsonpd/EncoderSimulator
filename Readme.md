# Encoder Simulator

This project simulates a quadrature encoder using an Arduino and several push buttons. This can be used for testing decoding algorithms etc.

## Schematics

## How to Use
In order to use this simulator simply hook connect the ground of the Arduino with the ground of the circuit being tested. Then ensure that the clockwise leading pin is hooked up to the input pin with the clockwise leading channel. Download the program to the Arduino.

## ToDo
- Remove reliance on delays for adjusting the speed
- Change wording to leading and trailing channels instead of A and B
- Create a module so it can be imported into other project.
- Add Schematic
- Add Serial interface
